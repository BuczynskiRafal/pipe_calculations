# pipe_calculations

The repository includes a package of methods for calculating the characteristic values of rainwater sewage systems, such as minimum and maximum slope, flow velocity, volumetric flow, channel filling height, channel depression, and validation of flow velocity, channel filling height and channel bottom slope.

Sample projects were also added in which the package was used to evaluate the diameters of rainwater pipes using the fuzzy logic "fuzzy logic.ipynb", "fuzzy.ipynb" and to validate the characteristics of "Pipe_validation.ipynb".
